I'm writing this work journal as an experiment. I think reflection can be a very powerful tool, and a weekly journal might be a nice way to reflect on the learnings of the week, but also to show yourself if you feel down or feel like you're not progressing - as a sort of proof that you actually are.

## Side projects

For this week, I worked on a side project of mine: a Reddit browser where you select your favourite subreddits, and the app gets the top posts from the selected reddits and presents them to you sorted by upvotes. The functionality is quite simple, so I played a TON with the design, trying to better understand color combinations and gradients. It's built with Gatsby and designed in Figma, and uses the Snoowrap JavaScript library to connect with the reddit API. The development went smoothly, with a lot of data massaging using the JavaScript array methods (seriously in love with those üòç)

I also added a small section to my personal website highlighting some of the technologies I'm familiar with. [Check it out](https://madsbrodt.com). I generally don't like the idea of "skill bars", as they tend to be quite arbitrary, but I think it creates value for personal employers to quickly get a feel if you'd be a right fit with their technology. It also adds some color and liveliness on my website which makes the design more interesting.

## Work

I am working with my team on creating a new "branding universe" to attract better talent in the future. The company I work for is generally considered "old fashioned", and the current recruiting site reflects that - even though the company is very different internally. So with this project, we are trying to show off how it actually is like working there. This involves design and development work, while contiounsly coordinating with HR to make sure our ideas are compatible with their systems.

## Problem solving

Finally, I try to code at least 15 minutes every day. That means, on the days where I don't feel like coding, I do 15 minutes and then stop. On most days, just beginning to code gets me going and I want to continue, which is a great thing. I prefer working on personal projects like the ones mentioned, but sometimes I practice on isolated coding problems on a site like [edabit.com](https://edabit.com). It's important to mix project work with occasional algorith-my questions. Projects are more "real-world", and teach you about the whole development process. Doing these classic "whiteboard" questions allow you to work on a single problem, and how to break it into smaller bits. It also teaches you about the inbuilt JavaScript functions you might not be familiar with.

I usually start by solving the problem in the most naive way - loops, nested "ifs", tons of variables etc. Once I have a working solution, I'll refactor it down as much as possible. When that works, I will check the solutions to see if there is a more optimal way of solving the problem. If there is, I will redo the problem with the new approach. This process is quite helpful for me, as I get to play around and solve the problem myself, but also learn if there is a better way. I recommend trying this method out if you're into these kinds of problems! They dont have to be super hard - it's just important to code and train the part of your brain that solves problems.

So that's it for this week. Stay tuned for more learnings next week!
